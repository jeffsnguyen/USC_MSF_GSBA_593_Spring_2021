# Abstract  
The mortgage-backed securities market is one of the important credit markets that serve two purposes: 1) providing credit-granting institutions such as banks with a vehicle to limit their risks exposure and 2) providing investors with opportunities to generate returns by taking on those risks. One of the lingering effects of The Great Recession of 2008 is the eroded trust in credit agencies’ abilities to accurately price mortgage-backed securities.  

The proposed research aims to develop a computer-based methodology to model a mortgage-backed security. The focus of the study is to structure a mortgage-backed security (MBS) from a pool of mortgage loans and return a fair valuation of the structured deal while accounting for credit default risks.  

The study will utilize credit data from sources such as the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and Fannie Mae. Credit data will be used to structure a Mortgage-Backed Security. The study will then simulate different credit defaults via Monte Carlo simulation methodology. The computational algorithms will be implemented in Python. The expected result is that the study will arrive at the fair value of the structured deal comparable to the actual results generated by the agency.  




# Introduction  
The US asset-backed securities market is a 11.2 trillion market as of 2020 (SIFMA). It covers an important consumer credit market of homeowners' loans. A well-functioned mortgage-backed securities market is instrumental in providing liquidity to important credit functions that drives the economy. The subprime crisis of 2008 has eroded trusts of investors in credit agencies’ abilities to accurately priced mortgage-backed securities. Thus, the study seeks to showcase a quantitative and thus, objective, method to price these structured securities.  

The proposed research consists of two integrated parts:  

## Part 1  
  
Implementation of the structured security: The research will utilize sample credit data of an actual Mortgage-Backed Security from a market data source such as Fannie MAe. The objective is to then, design the structured security based on the cash flow of each period from the credit pool. The desired outcome is a presentation of the cash flows of each tranche in the structured deal and their corresponded components: principal and interest payments.  

## Part 2  
Valuation of the structured security: The research will create a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate different credit default and prepayment scenarios to help determine the fair value of the structured deal. The desired outcome is metrics—yields and ratings—for each tranche in the structured deal.  

The results will then be compared with the actual MBS’s metrics to understand the effectiveness of the computer-based method and discuss other nuances of the differences between the quantitative method and reality.  

# Background
From the credit granting institutions’ perspective, each structured security has two main components: the pool of assets—the underlying receivables from homeowners' loans—and the pool of liabilities—the structured securities.  

## Hypothetical Case Study
When Bank of America (BoA) grants credits to consumers, it guarantees the consumer’s purchase of goods and services by making the immediate payments on behalf of the consumers to the vendors and receive periodic repayment from the consumers. BoA gets reimbursement for facilitating these transactions by charging a fee to the consumers as well as collecting interest rates on the credit amount. During the period from which the initial credit grant happens—when the consumers make the purchase—to the repayment of credit—when the consumer make the credit payment—BoA has exposed itself to two types of risks:
1.	Default risk: The risk that the consumer would not pay back the credit. Defaulted losses range from a percentage of to the full amount of the credit. This is an example of bad debt expense for BoA.
2.	Prepayment risk: The risk that consumer would pay back the credit earlier than expected. This scenario would result in a loss of expected income from interest payments for BoA.
To limit its expose to these risks, BoA would package these credits together into a Special Purpose Vehicle. This vehicle is the structured security. The structured security enables a third party, the investors, to assume the majority of the risks—Dodd-Frank regulations require credit lender to assume some of the risks compared to 0% pre-2008—by making payments to the BoA to guarantees these credits and hoping to recoup the principal amount at the end of the credit term as well as earning a premium on periodic interest amounts (Practical Law). This fair premium is what the study seeks to arrive at.
There are different types of structured securities, such as standard and strips. The scope of this study only covers a two-tranche special purpose vehicle, where each tranche receives both the principal and interest payments from the Special Purpose Vehicle.
Design and Methodology
This study’s structure is as follow.
1.	Implementation of the Structured Securities:
a.	Aggregation of the pool of credits: Determine the cash flows collections—from consumer’s repayments—for each period based on each credits’ notional, rate and term.
b.	Implement the default and prepayment likelihood and losses aspect to the pool of credits.
c.	Setup of the structured securities—two tranches—to receive cash flows from the pooled collections based on a default rate.
2.	Valuation of the Structured Securities:
a.	Metrics of the structured securities: From the cash flows of each tranches, study their respective internal rate of return and weighted average life.
b.	Simulation of default and prepayment scenarios: Run Monte Carlo simulations of default and prepayment scenarios to determine the fair market rate for each tranche as well as its corresponded ratings.
3.	Comparison to the actual agency’s metrics.
